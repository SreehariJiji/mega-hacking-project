COMP 357 Project 

This repository documents two controlled lab exercises completed for the course: OWASP Juice Shop and Kerberoasting (Active Directory). The work includes environment setup notes, configuration files, and evidence aligned with the submitted reports.

Attacks demonstrated:

Exercise 1 — OWASP Juice Shop:

DOM-based XSS

IDOR (basket bid manipulation)

Authentication bypass (SQLi-style)

Exercise 2 — Kerberoasting:

SPN-linked service account ticket extraction with controlled offline password recovery

Mitigation validation using a stronger service account password

Safety and Scope

All activities were performed only in course-authorized, isolated lab environments using synthetic accounts and intentionally vulnerable training software. No external systems, real users, or production data were targeted or tested.
